Next:

1. Save recommendation path (To enhance performance), to be used in the next run
2. Machine learning, to learn if the join is wrong, and update the list of wrong table relationship
	- Might use a parameter to set the limit of number iteration to be ran
	- Run the new program based on the mistakes made in the previous sessions (Learn)
	

	
Limitation:



Problems encountered during the dev.


1. Algorithm return multiple tablerelationship which causing problem in stack

	-Solution: 
	1. To still consider a table that already have been used. (Make a mark for relationship that has it). Put exception list table for relationship

	1. To only output 1 tablerelationship when the rel have the same col from and col to (So concatinate it, instead separate it) -- > Cannot use this solution, because it will break the keyword algorithm in the next step

2. If a table is wrongly joined with other table, then that table is no longer can be used for other iteration	

	-Solution:
	1. Make a list of known wrong join
